# Weather-Dashboard-5-day

There are 2 fetch blocks due to the instructions for this task stating that the fetch URL should use lon and lat rather than name. Hence there is the initial call using user input name which is converted into lon and lat for the second fetch call (which is used to populate the weather cards.)
