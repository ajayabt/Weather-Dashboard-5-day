# Weather Dashboard Challenge


## Description

This webpage is designed to show the current weather report for a city upon search. When searched, a city will be saved to the 'history' tabs. These can be clicked to display the weather for that city. 

There are 2 fetch blocks due to the instructions for this task stating that the fetch URL should use lon and lat rather than name. Hence there is the initial call using user input name which is converted into lon and lat for the second fetch call (which is used to populate the weather cards). I think I must have missed a trick here as I believe API would have worked simply using a city name, but it was a fun work around.

## Credits
We were provided with the HTML as starter code. Some bootstrap classes were already included in the HTML so I copied the linkin to enable bootstrap and that did a lot of the styling for me.  All javascript and the tiny amount of CSS is my own. Thank you to the bootcamp instructors and TAs who have enabled me to get this far!
